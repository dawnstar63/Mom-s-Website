We offer theory and ear training lessons as well.

For students preparing to apply to conservatories and pre-colleges, musicians embarking on professional careers, and those for whom piano is not their main instrument, I provide lessons covering music theory, dictation, solfege, and more. Short-term lessons before auditions are also offered. Please don't hesitate to contact me for more information.
